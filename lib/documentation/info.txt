We have the following Databases 
    1. questions = This holds all information about the various questions
    2. playersDB = This holds information about the various players
    3. [playerA][playerB] = This represents each individual players information
            so as we create a new player a database will be created that will 
            hold information for each player




how the hint was setup
-------------------------
1. In the database all questions have their corresponding hint to them.
2. first we create the hint for the current question in the createHint(string ..) method
3. store the locations for the hints from the answer array in an array of integers called hintLocations
4. do step 3 for no hints location stored in noHintLocations.
5. reset just our solution boxes "a".
6. populate the hintLocations and noHintLocations arrays.
7. create our answer for the hint options and store in an array called withHintAnswer.
8. populate the solution boxes to show the respective hints.

handling clicking an option when the hint is on
-------------------------------------------------
1. when i click on an option i first check if the user has actived hint or not.
2. if the user has activated hint, put the clicked button in the first location of the array
   without a hint.
